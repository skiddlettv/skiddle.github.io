<title>The London Eye</title>
<h1 style="text-align: center;font-family: system-ui;color: white;">The Building Process</h1><br><br><br><br>
<div id="textbox">
<p>The London Eye was planed by David Marks and Julia Barfield. First the company Arup was doing the construction planning, 
but there left when the building company Mitsubishi withdrew. The designs of the capsules are from Nick Bailey. 
The realization was carried out by the dutch steel construction company Hollandia. At the 10th September of 1999 a company named Smit-Tak tryed to lift up the finished wheel with a big crane, but the attempt failed. It took 1 Month and a week to get up the wheel correctly</p>
